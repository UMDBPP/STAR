===============================Rev 1============================
-Diodes polarity markings
-IC pin 1 markers
-22uH inductor package is wrong
-switch to 10 pin 50 mil cortex debug connector
-inductors closer to chip than caps
-upgrade FDG8842
-Swap P82B buffer with something else, use enable pin equipped part (NO MOSFETS)
-Missing 100pF decoupling capacitor on PCA9306 VREF2 pin
-Fix SERCOMs to avoid custom arduino core
-load on 28V bias
-Fix 3111 overshoot
-upgrade LDO to handle transients
-Zener on all voltage buses except 28V
-Add Pi-style protection circuitry
-Route bias voltage control pin
-External board - tent vias
-Add pullup resistor to SWCLK
-3.3V reg: output cap to 2.2uF ceramic, add bypass cap (100nF)
-Changed crystal to 7pf tuning

-External reroute w/ filled hole


===============================Rev 2============================
Switch Q5 gate and source in the 5V protection circuit
Remove pullups to external I2C bus or allow them to be shut off
Fix 28V bias
Resolve address conflict between RTC and BMX055 gyro
Fix PCA9306 footrpint (change to TI library)
Move the DEBUG_5V downstream of the protection circuit
Move chipselect pin for SD card to one that is mapped for the the Feather M0 - PA07 (D9) should work.
Fix clearances for cortex connector and Pi SD card
Fix Pi power supply issue
