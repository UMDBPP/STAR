# STAR
Sratification and Tribocharging Analysis of Regolith

## Purpose
This is a payload for the 2017 RockSatX project. It's purpose is to provide experimental data for validating a behavioral model proposed by Dr. Christine Hartzell.

The payload will:
* Observe stratification of varying bimodal grain size distribution under microgravity and external excitation
* Measure effect of tribocharging upon spherical non-conducting grains
